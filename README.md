From the main menu screen you can use hand tracking to navigate through the menu.

Screens that have hand tracking enabled are Main Menu screen and Exercise Menu screen. You can log out at any point.
View Progress provides charts showing you score and time to complete each exercise by date. You can navigate through the available charts using the arrow buttons.
Profile, displays the users information.
Comments display comments made by the therapist using the web application. These are dis-played by exercise, ordered by most recent first.
Within the my program menu there are three exercises to complete. Each has a tutorial gif to show the user what they are. When the user is within an exercise they can quit or wait for a timer to run out which will then move automatically to the next exercise.
All records are saved on completion of each exercise.
